# PHP Array Merge Pitfall: '+' Operator and Numerical Keys

This repository demonstrates a subtle yet common error in PHP related to array merging using the `+` operator, particularly when dealing with numerical keys.  The `+` operator behaves differently than expected, often leading to unexpected data loss.

The `bug.php` file contains code illustrating the erroneous behavior, while `bugSolution.php` shows the corrected approach using `array_merge()`.  Understanding this distinction is crucial to writing robust and reliable PHP code.
